+ Outlier Gene Expression in Cancer

	1. Starting with prostate cancer, understand really weird gene expression outliers

		○ Data set

			▪ CPC-GENE RNA-seq data : normalized by FPKM
			▪ TCGA Prostate Cancer RNA-seq data : normalized by FPKM
			▪ SU2C RNA-seq data : normalized by FPKM

		○ Develop new outlier detection strategy

			### 1. Function for making z-score matrix using each method (8 methods)
			# - Generate function for calculating z-score and Kmean cluster using each method
			#   1. Use mean and SD
			#   2. Use mean and SD excluding zero values
			#   3. Use trimmed mean and trimmed SD
			#   4. Use trimmed mean and trimmed SD excluding zero values
			#   5. Use median and MAD
			#   6. Use median and MAD excluding zero values
			#   7. Use K mean cluster
			#   8. Use K mean cluster excluding zero values

			### 2. Function for outlier detection (calculating z-score range and kmean fraction)
			# - Generate function for calculating z-score range and kmean fraction
			#   1. Calculate a range of z-score
			#   2. Calculate a fraction of Kmean with smaller fraction
			# - Generate gene-wise matrix

			### 3. Function for checking whether the outliers are highly abundant or lowly abundant
			# - Generate the direction matrix

			### 4. Function for making patient-wise outlier matrix
			# 1. P-value < 0.05
			# 2. Bonferroni  correction < 0.05
			# 3. Adjusted p-value < 0.05
			# - Generate function for marking the patients over/under threshold
			# - Generate function for calculating the number of outliers per patient

			### 5. File check - match the name of patients
			# - Match the name of patients between FPKM file and z-score file

			### 6. Function for making heatmap of z-score and FPKM
			# - Generate function for making heatmap in z-score and fpkm space

			### 7. Function for making Waterfall plot
			# - Generate function for making waterfall plot with z-score and FPKM with showing the fraction of patients

			### 8. Function for checking out the technical problem
			# - Generate heatmap for the fraction of genes enriched on each chromosome
			# - Check if there is any chromosome of which genes are enriched less than 20%

			### 9. Function for making heatmap of each chromosome position
			# - Generate function for making heatmap for each chromosomal position

			### 10. Function for ranking outliers
			# - Generate the ranking of outliers using rank product method
			# - Generate heatmap for top 1000 ranked outliers in FPKM space
			# - Generate heatmap for top 1000 ranked outliers in z-score
			# - Count the number of outliers per patient
			# - Generate heatmap for top 1000 ranked outliers ordered by the number of outliers per patient

			### 11. Function for making multi-waterfall plot with clinical data
			# 1. ISUP
			# 2. PSA
			# 3. Age
			# 4. Tumor grade
			# - Merge clinical data in waterfall plot

			### 12. Function for making bar plot of gene rank on each chromosome position
			# - Generate bar plot for each chromosome with rank of genes

			### 13. File check - Check the correlation between FPKM and z-score
			# - Generate an error if the correlation is low
