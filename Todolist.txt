+ Outlier Gene Expression in Cancer

	1. Starting with prostate cancer, understand really weird gene expression outliers (Use CPC-GENE RNA-seq data : normalized by FPKM)
	▪ Define "really weird" genes with three methods for each transcript
		○ Use mean and SD
		○ Use median and MAD
		○ Use trimmed-mean and trimmed-SD
	▪ Calculate the z-score and filter the genes by the range of z-score (max Z – min Z for that gene, across patients)
		○ Make heatmap for each methods
		○ Make waterfall plot with z-score and FPKM value with showing the fraction of patients in which a gene is detected
		○ Do a direct comparison amongst three methods and make correlation plot (use Spearman correlation)
	▪ Make consensus clustering with top 200 outliers by the union of three methods
	▪ Sort genes by their chromosome position
		○ Check whether outlier genes are preferentially on certain chromosomes (do this with a hypergeometric test for each chromosome and/or chromosome arm, followed by multiple testing correction, using  BL.stats.general.
		○ See if that reveals any trends such as CNAs or enhancer changes
	▪ Check for enrichment in specific pathways (g:Profiler)
	▪ Check to see what the best hits with very low (i.e. negative) z-scores
	

	2. Quantify different mechanisms by which this can happen
	▪ enhancer hijacking
	▪ copy-neutral SVs (translocations, inversions)
	▪ non-coding SNVs & indels
	▪ extrachromosomal DNA
	▪ synonymous SNVs for protein abundance?
	▪ associations with high miRNA, circRNA, m6A features
